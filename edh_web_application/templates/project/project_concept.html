	The <strong>task</strong> of the <em>Epigraphic Database Heidelberg (EDH)</em> is the systematic entry of ancient Latin and bilingual (usually Latin and Greek) inscriptions into a complex database. As a result of its interdisciplinary approach, conception and method of work <em>EDH</em> is to be counted among the leading international database projects which collects and provides reliable historical analysis of epigraphic monuments. A distinguishing feature of <em>EDH</em> is its <a href="/hilfe/liste/provinzen" target="_blank">regional focus</a>, its capability of combining the stored metadata as freely as possible and the reciprocal linking of the <a href="/inhalt/einfacheSuche" target="_blank"><i><em>Epigraphic Text Database</em></i></a>&nbsp;with three of the constituent databases of <em>EDH</em>, the <a href="/inhalt/bibliographie" target="_blank"><i><em>Bibliographic Database</em></i></a>, the <a href="/inhalt/fotos" target="_blank"><i><em>Photographic Database</em></i></a> and the <em>Epigraphic Geographic Database.</em></p>

	Its <strong>aim</strong> is to render the epigraphic documentation of the provinces of the Roman Empire as completely and reliably as possible for online research work. Under the leadership of the <em>Commissione epigrafia e informatica of the AIEGL</em> a decision was made in 2003 to create an international epigraphic database confederation <a href="/projekt/geschichte#anker11/2003" target="_blank"><em>EAGLE</em></a> <em>(Electronic Archives of Greek and Latin Epigraphy)</em>. Since then <em>EDH</em> is responsible for the inscriptions of the <strong>Roman provinces</strong>. The inscriptions of Italy which had already been entered into EDH were passed on to the <em>Epigraphic Database Rome (EDR)</em>. It is now the domain of EDR to improve these records as well as adding to their number in order to complete the entry of all inscriptions of Italy. The long term aim of this confederation is to make all Latin and Greek inscriptions from Antiquity available on the Internet in a standardised system of criteria. It was with this in mind that <em>EDR</em> was founded on the model of and in cooperation with <em>EDH</em>.</p>
	<p>
	<strong>Concept</strong>: The <em>Epigraphic Text Database</em> is the heart of <em>EDH</em> and contains about 78.000 inscriptions at present. Almost all of the records present texts, which have already either been edited in the monumental Inscription corpora – in many cases still valid, but often do not fulfill the standards of modern textual editorial practice – or published, revised and discussed in thousands of scholarly articles. The texts and metadata of the inscriptions are thus presented on the basis of up to date scholarly research. One of the basic principles of the working method of <em>EDH</em> is that readings are not simply accepted from the editions and secondary literature. As much as possible these readings are verified at least on the basis of drawings or photographs – in the case of the latter these belong to the records of the <em>Photographic Database</em> – or ideally through autopsy. By means of the "status field" the user of the database is informed about the manner of verification of the readings.</p>
	<p>
	The revision of the inscriptions being processed for the <em>Epigraphic Text Database</em> is based on a card-index. On the one hand the publications presented in <em>L'Année Épigraphique</em> since 1888 are systematically collected. On the other hand in which the relevant <a href="/inhalt/einfacheSuche#ankerDivPhasen">corpora editions</a> and <a href="/inhalt/einfacheSuche#ankerDivPhasen">local publications</a> are systematically collected according to the regional method applied by <em>EDH</em>. <em>EDH</em> enjoys a lively exchange of information with native and foreign scholars and institutions. This makes it possible within the framework of <a href="/hilfe/liste/externeMitarbeiter" target="_blank">external cooperation</a> to include their specialist and regionally founded profile in the data presented by <em>EDH</em>.</p>
