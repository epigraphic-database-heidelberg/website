"<p>The <strong>task</strong> of the <em>Epigraphic Database Heidelberg "
"(EDH)</em> is the systematic entry of ancient Latin and bilingual "
"(usually Latin and Greek) inscriptions into a complex database. As a "
"result of its interdisciplinary approach, conception and method of work "
"<em>EDH</em> is to be counted among the leading international database "
"projects which collects and provides reliable historical analysis of "
"epigraphic monuments. A distinguishing feature of <em>EDH</em> is its <a "
"href=\"/hilfe/liste/provinzen\">regional focus</a>, its capability of "
"combining the stored metadata as freely as possible and the reciprocal "
"linking of the <a href=\"/inhalt/einfacheSuche\"><i><em>Epigraphic Text "
"Database</em></i></a>&nbsp;with three of the constituent databases of "
"<em>EDH</em>, the <a href=\"/inhalt/bibliographie\"><i><em>Bibliographic "
"Database</em></i></a>, the <a href=\"/inhalt/fotos\"><i><em>Photographic "
"Database</em></i></a> and the <em>Epigraphic Geographic "
"Database.</em></p><p>Its <strong>aim</strong> is to render the epigraphic"
" documentation of the provinces of the Roman Empire as completely and "
"reliably as possible for online research work. Under the leadership of "
"the <em>Commissione epigrafia e informatica of the AIEGL</em> a decision "
"was made in 2003 to create an international epigraphic database "
"confederation <a "
"href=\"/projekt/geschichte#anker11/2003\"><em>EAGLE</em></a> "
"<em>(Electronic Archives of Greek and Latin Epigraphy)</em>. Since then "
"<em>EDH</em> is responsible for the inscriptions of the <strong>Roman "
"provinces</strong>. The inscriptions of Italy which had already been "
"entered into EDH were passed on to the <em>Epigraphic Database Rome "
"(EDR)</em>. It is now the domain of EDR to improve these records as well "
"as adding to their number in order to complete the entry of all "
"inscriptions of Italy. The long term aim of this confederation is to make"
" all Latin and Greek inscriptions from Antiquity available on the "
"Internet in a standardised system of criteria. It was with this in mind "
"that <em>EDR</em> was founded on the model of and in cooperation with "
"<em>EDH</em>.</p><p><strong>Concept</strong>: The <em>Epigraphic Text "
"Database</em> is the heart of <em>EDH</em> and contains about 78.000 "
"inscriptions at present. Almost all of the records present texts, which "
"have already either been edited in the monumental Inscription corpora – "
"in many cases still valid, but often do not fulfill the standards of "
"modern textual editorial practice – or published, revised and discussed "
"in thousands of scholarly articles. The texts and metadata of the "
"inscriptions are thus presented on the basis of up to date scholarly "
"research. One of the basic principles of the working method of "
"<em>EDH</em> is that readings are not simply accepted from the editions "
"and secondary literature. As much as possible these readings are verified"
" at least on the basis of drawings or photographs – in the case of the "
"latter these belong to the records of the <em>Photographic Database</em> "
"– or ideally through autopsy. By means of the \"status field\" the user "
"of the database is informed about the manner of verification of the "
"readings.</p><p>The revision of the inscriptions being processed for the "
"<em>Epigraphic Text Database</em> is based on a card-index. On the one "
"hand the publications presented in <em>L'Année Épigraphique</em> since "
"1888 are systematically collected. On the other hand in which the "
"relevant <a href=\"/inhalt/einfacheSuche#ankerDivPhasen\">corpora "
"editions</a> and <a href=\"/inhalt/einfacheSuche#ankerDivPhasen\">local "
"publications</a> are systematically collected according to the regional "
"method applied by <em>EDH</em>. <em>EDH</em> enjoys a lively exchange of "
"information with native and foreign scholars and institutions. This makes"
" it possible within the framework of <a "
"href=\"/hilfe/liste/externeMitarbeiter\">external cooperation</a> to "
"include their specialist and regionally founded profile in the data "
"presented by <em>EDH</em>.</p>"
