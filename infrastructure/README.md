#EDH Infrastructure
The EDH web application is built around an Apache Solr search index. Here's everything to set up the EDH backend:

* data: CSV files with textual data from all EDH databases (inscription, foto, bibliography, geography)
* solr-conf: configuration folder of Apache Solr cores
* scripts: convenience scripts to reload csv files from data folder into Apache Solr cores
